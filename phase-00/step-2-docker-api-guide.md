# Phase 00 â€“ Step 2 Guide: Minimal API with Docker

This guide explains how the minimal API was set up and how to run it using Docker Compose.

## What Was Done

1. **Created Docker Compose file** (`compose/phase-00.yml`):

   - Defines an `api` service using the official Node.js 22 Alpine image.
   - Mounts the local `services/api` folder into the container.
   - Exposes port 8080.
   - Connects the service to two networks: `front_net` and `back_net`.

2. **Created API code** (`services/api/server.js`):

   - Simple Express server with a single endpoint:
     - `GET /health` returns `{status: "ok"}`.

3. **Created package.json** (`services/api/package.json`):
   - Defines Express as a dependency
   - Enables ES6 modules with `"type": "module"`
   - Includes npm scripts for running the server

## How to Run

1. **Start the API service:**
   ```bash
   docker compose -f compose/phase-00.yml up --build
   ```
2. **Test the API endpoint:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080/health
   ```
   - You should see: `{"status":"ok"}`

## Troubleshooting

- If you get a connection error, make sure Docker Desktop is running and port 8080 is not in use.
- If you see "ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/app/package.json'" error:
  - Ensure `package.json` exists in `services/api/` directory
  - Check that the volume mount path in `compose/phase-00.yml` is correct (`../services/api:/app`)
- If you see missing module errors, ensure Express is listed in `package.json` dependencies
- If you see ES module import errors, ensure `"type": "module"` is set in `package.json`

---

Once you see the health check response, phase 00 is complete and running. You can now commit this step and proceed to the next phase.
